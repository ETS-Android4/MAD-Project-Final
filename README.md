# BMSCE Learn

Abstract

Recently the popularity of smartphones has promoted communication for daily life, but it also brings new challenges for current classroom teaching. For example, some students spend too much time playing with phones instead of learning in the classroom. How to effectively instruct students to use phones and promote teaching becomes a very tricky problem. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a new real-time interaction platform for classroom teaching based on a smartphone APP, which adopts the extensive multilayer framework and the quantifiable real-time interaction. In BMSCE Learn, it’s easy for teachers to post assignments, announcements, and manage courses and for the student to keep track of important announcements, assignments, and manage courses. What’s more, this platform can strengthen the interaction between teachers and students, and stimulate the interest of all students to participate in classroom learning. 

Introduction

In recent years, with the rapid development of network information technology, many new teaching modes and methods have emerged in education such as network courses, MOOCs, and flipped classrooms. Though these new modes can make teaching convenient for cross-regions, classroom teaching is still a very important teaching model in the current education environment. To deal with the shortcomings of the existing classroom teaching, we propose a new real-time interactive teaching method, which constructs a real-time interaction platform for classroom teaching based on a smartphone application. The application was developed using Java, XML, SQLite (database), and Android Studio as the IDE. The application runs on any Android Device that has Lollipop 5.0 and above.
